More than just designing interfaces, I spot clear business opportunities—showing how every UX decision translates into <span class=\"font-bold text-secondary\">Tangible Value</span> for both companies and their customers.\n My strength lies in bringing together diverse teams—design, development, business, legal, risk, marketing—and helping them work as one. In short: <span class=\"font-bold\">I translate the needs of some into the language of others</span>.\n I've led the design of web and mobile applications, financial products, and enterprise platforms that seamlessly integrate front and back end.",
