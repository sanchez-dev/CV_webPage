"opening": "I’ve spent the last 13 years turning key insights into accessible digital experiences that people can actually understand, use, and enjoy. More than just designing interfaces, I spot clear business opportunities—showing how every UX decision translates into tangible value for both companies and their customers.\n My strength lies in bringing together diverse teams—design, development, business, legal, risk, marketing—and helping them work as one. In short: I translate the needs of some into the language of others.\n I’ve led the design of web and mobile applications, financial products, and enterprise platforms that seamlessly integrate front and back end.",
